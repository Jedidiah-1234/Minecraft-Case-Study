                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox video game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[3] The game also features an optional achievement system.[4] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a second and third-person perspective.[5] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes, referred to as blocks—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can break, or mine, blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[6] The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[7][8] Comparatively, the game's physics system has been described as unrealistic, with nearly all blocks unaffected by gravity.[9]</p>

                <p>Players can also craft a wide variety of items, such as armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or shovels), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. They may also freely construct helpful blocks—such as furnaces which can cook food and smelt ores,[10] and torches that produce light—or exchange items with a villager (NPC) through trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.[11][12] The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.[13]</p>
                <p>The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player).[14][15][16] While there are limits on the world's verticality, Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane, though the player is limited to traversing up to 30 million blocks from the world's center.[17] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[18][19] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava.[16] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.[20]</p>
            
                <p>New players are given a randomly selected default character skin out of nine possibilities, including Steve or Alex,[21][22] but are able to create and upload their own skins.[23] Players encounter various mobs (short for mobile entities) including animals, villagers, and hostile creatures.[12][24] Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, witches, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.[25][26] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear and are not standing in water.[27] Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).[28] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.[29]</p>

            <div id="dimensions">
                <h2>Dimensions</h2>
                <p>Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld (the main world where the player spawns): the Nether and the End.[28]</p>
            </div>

            <div id="theNether">
                <h3>The Nether</h3>
                <p>The Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via a player-built obsidian portal; newer versions of the game feature naturally generated damaged portals that the player can repair.[30] The Nether contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.[31] Mobs that populate the Nether include shrieking, fireball-shooting ghasts, alongside anthropomorphic mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts.[32] The piglins in particular have a bartering system, where players can give them gold ingots and receive items in return.[33] Structures known as Nether Fortresses generate in the Nether, containing unique mobs such as wither skeletons and blazes, which can drop blaze rods needed to access the End dimension.[34] The dimension also features bastion remnants, a structure that occasionally contains the netherite upgrade smithing template. This item is required to upgrade diamond equipment to netherite, the most durable material in the game.[35] The player can also choose to build an optional boss mob known as the Wither, using skulls obtained from wither skeletons and soul sand.[36][37]</p>
            </div>

            <div id="theEnd">
                <h3>The End</h3>
                <p>The End can be reached through an end portal, consisting of twelve end portal frames. End portals are found in underground structures in the Overworld known as strongholds. To find strongholds, players must craft eyes of ender using an ender pearl and blaze powder. Eyes of ender can then be thrown, traveling in the direction of the stronghold. Once the player reaches the stronghold, they can place eyes of ender into each portal frame to activate the end portal.[38] The dimension consists of islands floating in a dark, bottomless void. A boss enemy called the Ender Dragon guards the largest, central island.[39] Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which, when entered, cues the game's ending credits and the End Poem, a roughly 1,500-word work written by Irish novelist Julian Gough,[40] which takes about nine minutes to scroll past,[41] is the game's only narrative text,[42] and the only text of significant length directed at the player.[43]: 10–12  At the conclusion of the credits, the player is teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.[44] Players can also explore further regions of the End beyond the main island, which can harbor structures known as end cities or ships to find valuable loot as well.</p>

                <h3>Survival mode</h3>
                <p>In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[16] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter in order to survive at night.[16] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game unless the player is playing on peaceful difficulty.[45] If the hunger bar is empty, automatic healing stops and depletes. Health replenishes when players have a full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful.[45]</p>
                <!-- add photo and text in a card form-->
                <p>Upon losing all health, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor.[46][47] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points (commonly referred to as "xp" or "exp") to as by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food.[48] Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[25]</p>
                <p>The game features two more game modes based on survival, known as "hardcore mode" and "adventure mode". Hardcore mode plays identically to survival mode, but features permadeath, meaning players only have one life, forcing them to delete the world or explore it as a spectator after death.[49] Adventure mode was added to the game in a post-launch update,[50] and prevents the player from directly modifying the game's world. It was designed primarily for use in custom maps, allowing map designers to let players experience it as intended.[50][51]</p>

                <p>In creative mode, players have access to an infinite number of nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or mine them instantly.[52] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, while their characters do not take any damage nor are affected by hunger.[53][54] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.[52]</p>

                <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
                <p>See also: Minecraft server
                    Multiplayer in Minecraft enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. It is available through direct game-to-game multiplayer, LAN play, local split screen (console-only), and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted).[55] Players can run their own servers, use a hosting provider, or connect directly to another player's game via Xbox Live. Single-player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup.[56] Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server.[55] Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. The largest and most popular server is Hypixel, which has been visited by over 14 million unique players.[57][58] Player versus player combat (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players.[59]</p>

            <div id="minecraftRealms">
                <h3>Minecraft Realms</h3>
                <p>In 2013, Mojang announced Minecraft Realms, a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without having to set up their own.[60][61] Unlike a standard server, only invited players can join Realms servers, and these servers do not use IP addresses. Minecraft: Java Edition Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at a time. Minecraft Realms server owners can invite up to 3,000 people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at one time.[62] The Minecraft: Java Edition Realms servers do not support user-made plugins, but players can play custom Minecraft maps.[63] Minecraft Bedrock Realms servers support user-made add-ons, resource packs, behavior packs, and custom Minecraft maps.[62] At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, support for cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms was added through Realms starting in June 2016,[64] with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch support to come later in 2017,[65] and support for virtual reality devices. On 31 July 2017, Mojang released the beta version of the update allowing cross-platform play.[66] Nintendo Switch support for Realms was released in July 2018.[67]</p>

            <div id="modification">
                <h2>Modification</h2>
                <p>The modding community consists of fans, users and third-party programmers. Using a variety of application program interfaces that have arisen over time, they have produced a wide variety of downloadable content for Minecraft, such as modifications, texture packs and custom maps. Modifications of the Minecraft code, called mods, add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, items, and mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms.[68][69] The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as mini-maps, waypoints, and durability counters, to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media.[70] While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by reverse engineering the code, Mojang has also enhanced vanilla Minecraft with official frameworks for modification, allowing the production of community-created resource packs, which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds.[71] Players can also create their own "maps" (custom world save files) that often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play.[72] Mojang added an adventure mode in August 2012[73] and "command blocks" in October 2012,[51] which were created specially for custom maps in Java Edition. Data packs, introduced in version 1.13 of the Java Edition, allow further customization, including the ability to add new achievements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, and world generation.[74][75]</p>
                <!-- add photo and text in a card form-->
                <p>The Xbox 360 Edition supported downloadable content, which was available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store; these content packs usually contained additional character skins.[76] It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing "mash-up packs", which combined texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game's sounds, music and user interface.[77] The first mash-up pack (and by extension, the first texture pack) for the Xbox 360 Edition was released on 4 September 2013, and was themed after the Mass Effect franchise.[78] Unlike Java Edition, however, the Xbox 360 Edition did not support player-made mods or custom maps.[79] A cross-promotional resource pack based on the Super Mario franchise by Nintendo was released exclusively for the Wii U Edition worldwide on 17 May 2016,[80] and later bundled free with the Nintendo Switch Edition at launch. Another based on Fallout was released on consoles that December,[81] and for Windows and Mobile in April 2017.[82] In April 2018, malware was discovered in several downloadable user-made Minecraft skins for use with the Java Edition of the game.[83][84] Avast stated that nearly 50,000 accounts were infected, and when activated, the malware would attempt to reformat the user's hard drive.[84][83] Mojang promptly patched the issue, and released a statement stating that "the code would not be run or read by the game itself",[83] and would run only when the image containing the skin itself was opened.[85]</p>
                <p>In June 2017, Mojang released an update known as the "Discovery Update" to the Bedrock version of the game.[86] The update includes a new map, a new game mode, the "Marketplace", a catalogue of user-generated content that gives Minecraft creators "another way to make a living from the game", and more.[87][88][89]</p>
