                            Mojang signed Minecraft building community, FyreUK, to help render the environments into Minecraft. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi's informal settlements and is in the planning phase. The Block by Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, Mina Kvarter (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.

                            Minecraft has also been used for education. In 2011, MinecraftEdu formed to introduce Minecraft into schools. Working to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson. Near the end of 2012, MinecraftEdu claimed to have reached around 250,000 students through the company. The version of the game with lessons for various subjects such as history, language arts and science. For example one teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how cell functions work! Minecraft also has alot of potential within computer-aided design, with the potential to impact the industry.

                    Following the initial surge in popularity in 2010, other video games were criticised for having similarities to Minecraft being called "clones", often due to being built with inspiration from Minecraft, or a superficial similarity. Examples include Ace of Spades, CastleMiner, CraftWorld, FortressCraft, Terraria, BlockWorld 3D, Total Miner, and Luanti (formerly Minetest). Also an adaptation of the alpha version of Minecraft for the Nintendo DS, titled DScraft, has been released; noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system. In response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP, various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms not to officially receive Minecraft at the time. These clone titles include UCraft (Nexis Games), Cube Life: Island Survival (Cypronia), Discovery (Noowanda), Battleminer (Wobbly Tooth Games), Cube Creator 3D (Big John Games), and Stone Shire (Finger Gun Games). Though fears were found false when minecraft finally releases on Nintendo consoles.

The event included the official launch of Minecraft; keynote speeches, including one by Persson; building and costume contests; Minecraft-themed breakout classes; exhibits by leading gaming and Minecraft-related companies; commemorative merchandise; and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well-known contributors from the Minecraft community. In 2016, Minecon was held in-person for the last time, with the following years featuring annual livestreams on minecraft.net and YouTube instead.
