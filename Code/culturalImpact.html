                    Minecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development.[267] As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development.[346]

                            Social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit have played a significant role in popularizing Minecraft.[347] Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos.[348] In 2010, Minecraft-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[349] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million Minecraft-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[350] The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube's gaming scene during the entire 2010s; in 2014, it was the second-most searched term on the entire platform.[351] By 2018, it was still YouTube's biggest game globally.[352]

                    Some popular commentators have received employment at Machinima, a now-defunct gaming video company that owned a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube.[349] The Yogscast is a British company that regularly produces Minecraft videos; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views, and their panel at Minecon 2011 had the highest attendance.[349][353] Another well-known YouTube personality is Jordan Maron, known online as Captain Sparklez, who has also created many Minecraft music parodies, including "Revenge", a parody of Usher's "DJ Got Us Falling in Love". Minecraft's popularity on YouTube was described by Polygon as quietly dominant, although in 2019, thanks in part to PewDiePie's playthroughs of the game, Minecraft experienced a visible uptick in popularity on the platform.[351][354] YouTube later announced that on 14 December 2021 that the total amount of Minecraft-related views on the website have exceeded one trillion.[355]

In a panel at Minecon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks.[349] In 2012, a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab, Cody Sumter, said:

                            In September 2012, Mojang began the Block by Block project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real-world environments in Minecraft.[364][365] The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see. Using Minecraft, the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game

                            Mojang signed Minecraft building community, FyreUK, to help render the environments into Minecraft. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi's informal settlements and is in the planning phase. The Block by Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, Mina Kvarter (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.[366][367]

                            Minecraft has also been used in educational settings.[9] In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson.[375] In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company.[376] A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore.[376] Another teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how cell functions work.[375] Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in Minecraft, and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they visit it in real life.[377] Minecraft may also prove as an innovation in computer-aided design.[378] Minecraft offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry.[379]

                    Following the initial surge in popularity of Minecraft in 2010, other video games were criticised for having various similarities to Minecraft, and some were described as being "clones", often due to a direct inspiration from Minecraft, or a superficial similarity. Examples include Ace of Spades, CastleMiner, CraftWorld, FortressCraft, Terraria, BlockWorld 3D, Total Miner,[390] and Luanti (formerly Minetest).[391] David Frampton, designer of The Blockheads, reported that one failure of his 2D game was the "low resolution pixel art" that too closely resembled the art in Minecraft, which resulted in "some resistance" from fans.[392] A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of Minecraft for the Nintendo DS, titled DScraft, has been released; it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system.[393] In response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP, various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms not to officially receive Minecraft at the time.[394] These clone titles include UCraft (Nexis Games),[395] Cube Life: Island Survival (Cypronia),[396] Discovery (Noowanda),[397] Battleminer (Wobbly Tooth Games),[398] Cube Creator 3D (Big John Games),[399] and Stone Shire (Finger Gun Games).[400] Despite this, the fears of fans were unfounded, with official Minecraft releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming.[401][402][403]

                    In November 2024, artificial intelligence companies Decart and Etched released Oasis, an artificially generated version of Minecraft, as a proof of concept. Every in-game element is completely AI generated in real time and the model does not store world data, leading to "hallucinations" such as items and blocks appearing that were not there before.[408]

                    Minecon, now known as Minecraft Live, is an annual official fan convention dedicated to Minecraft which usually reveals new games or feature drops, among others. The first full Minecon was held in November 2011 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.[409] The event included the official launch of Minecraft; keynote speeches, including one by Persson; building and costume contests; Minecraft-themed breakout classes; exhibits by leading gaming and Minecraft-related companies; commemorative merchandise; and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well-known contributors from the Minecraft community.[410] In 2016, Minecon was held in-person for the last time, with the following years featuring annual livestreams on minecraft.net and YouTube instead.
